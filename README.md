# Uncommon HTML File Upload Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to file uploads in HTML. The bug stems from improper handling of the asynchronous nature of file uploads using the `<input type="file">` element.  The solution involves more robust error handling and potentially using Promises or async/await for better asynchronous operation management.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with larger files or slower network connections.
